# Library of Eagle components made by Nikodem Bartnik for his projects
I will update the library and list of components as frequent as I can. As for now I am only adding here components that I am using for my projects. Feel free to use and modify it!
Here is what you can find in the library:
- LM358DR: Operational Amplifier
- BAT-HLD-001-THM: Simple battery holder for CR2032 battery
- CMA-6542PF: Electret microphone
- PTS647SN50SMTR2LFS: SMD tact switch (4,5 x 4,5mm)
- JS202011AQN: small THT slide switch
- ICSP Header: this header can be found on every Arduino board
- DRV8876NPWPR: DC motor driver with current feedback (HTSSOP-16 case)
- ZXTR2012K: Linear voltage regulator 12V 0.06A output, up to 100V input voltage
- U-USBBR04P-F000: USB - Type B THT socket 
- FDN340P: P MOSFET SOT23
- IFX27001TFV50: 40V 1.4V @ 1A Fixed 5V TO-252-2(DPAK) Linear Voltage Regulator
- LM3480: LM3480 100-mA, SOT-23, Quasi Low-Dropout Linear Voltage Regulator
- TMC2226: Step/Dir Drivers for Two-Phase Bipolar Stepper Motors up to 2.8A peak
